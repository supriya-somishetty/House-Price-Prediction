# House-Price-Prediction
The "House Price Prediction" project focuses on predicting housing prices using machine learning techniques. By leveraging popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (sklearn), Matplotlib, Seaborn this project provides an end-to-end solution for accurate price estimation.
## Overview of the Project
The "House Price Prediction" project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict housing prices based on various features. This prediction task is of great significance in real estate and finance, enabling informed decision-making for buyers, sellers, and investors. By employing machine learning algorithms and a curated dataset, this project provides a powerful tool for estimating house prices.
## Key Features
* **Data Collection**: The project utilizes the "Housing" dataset.The dataset contains features such as house area, number of bedrooms, parking etc. Using Pandas, the data is collected and processed
*  **Data Visualization**: The project employs data visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset. Matplotlib and Seaborn are utilized to create visualizations such as scatter plots, and correlation matrices. These visualizations provide a deeper understanding of the relationships between features and help identify trends and patterns.
*  **Train-Test Split**: To evaluate the performance of the regression model, the project employs the train-test split technique. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets, ensuring that the model is trained on a portion of the data and evaluated on unseen data. This allows for an accurate assessment of the model's predictive capabilities.
*  **Regression Model using Linear Regression**: The project utilizes the Linear Regression algorithm to build the regression model.Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to find the best-fitting straight line (known as the regression line) through the data points by minimizing the difference between the observed and predicted values. The Scikit-learn library provides an implementation of Linear Regression that is utilized in this project.
*  **Model Evaluation**: The project assesses the performance of the regression model using evaluation metrics such as R-squared error and mean absolute error. R-squared error measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that can be explained by the model, while mean absolute error quantifies the average difference between the predicted and actual house prices. These metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy and precision. Additionally, a scatter plot is created to visualize the predicted prices against the actual prices.
